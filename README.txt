All of my code has been tested in Dbeaver and works! i ran a few simple queries
to check if the data was indeed inserted into my database and everything was golden.
I have attatched both my table creation and my data insertion in seperate files and
attatched my erd. Below I will like the Host/Server, User & Default database, as well as the password if you would like to test yourself. DataThank you and have a good day!

Default-Database/Username: kpulqwej

Password: wJmUD-O1xC-2nbUJl353sW82S9MD-v2T
